# API Usage

The API can be accessed at: .

## Testing and mock data

Mock data has been loaded into the database so that `DELETE` endpoints function correctly during testing. 
For the delete test to work it is necessary to have a .jpg file named `'tomahawk'` in the `/static/img/` directory.


## Error handling

```{
    "success": False,
    "error": error,
    "message": error message
}```

The API will return one of the following errors when a request fails:

```
- 400 -- Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server
- 401 -- AuthError - Error message
- 403 -- Forbidden - forbidden
- 404 -- Not Found - The requested resource could not be found
- 405 -- Method Not Allowed - The specified method is not allowed for the endpoint
- 500 -- Internal Server Error - The server encountered an unexpected condition
```

## Database Schema

Here is a representation of the db schema (models.py):

```
Company
- id (primary key)
- name
- city
- state
- address
- phone

Product
- id (primary key
- name
- image
- description
- company_id (foreign key to company.id)

Every field must be populated. Constraints are enforced in the backend so that no fields are null.
