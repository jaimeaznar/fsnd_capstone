# API Usage

The API can be accessed at: https://fsnd-jaiazn-capstone-app.herokuapp.com

REQUIRED HAS BEEN DISABLED SO AS TO REDUCE CALLS TO AUTHO WHEN TESTING. 

## Testing and mock data

Mock data has been loaded into the database so that `DELETE` endpoints function correctly during testing. 
For the delete test to work it is necessary to have a .jpg file named `'tomahawk'` in the `/static/img/` directory.


## Error handling

```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": error,
    "message": error message
}
```

The API will return one of the following errors when a request fails:

```
- 400 -- Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server
- 401 -- AuthError - Error message
- 403 -- Forbidden - forbidden
- 404 -- Not Found - The requested resource could not be found
- 405 -- Method Not Allowed - The specified method is not allowed for the endpoint
- 500 -- Internal Server Error - The server encountered an unexpected condition

```

## Database Schema

Here is a representation of the db schema (models.py):


Company
- id (primary key)
- name
- city
- state
- address
- phone

Product
- id (primary key
- name
- image
- description
- company_id (foreign key to company.id)

Every field must be populated. Constraints are enforced in the backend so that no fields are null. 


## Role Based Access Control

There are 2 roles utilized in this project. They are `Director` and `Manager`. All `CRUD`endpoints require the user to be authenticated with one of the roles listed above.

### Permission Overview

Director

- get:company
- post:company
- patch:company
- delete:company
- get:product
- post:product
- patch:product
- delete:product

Manager

Users (2) have already been set up with each of the 2 available roles (credentials will be provided in the project submission details). JWT token has an expirating time of 24 hrs.
